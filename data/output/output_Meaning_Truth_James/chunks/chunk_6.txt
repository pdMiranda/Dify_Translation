What misleads so many of them is possibly also the fact that the
universes of discourse of Schiller, Dewey, and myself are panoramas of
different extent, and that what the one postulates explicitly the other
provisionally leaves only in a state of implication, while the reader
thereupon considers it to be denied. Schiller's universe is the
smallest, being essentially a psychological one. He starts with but one
sort of thing, truth-claims, but is led ultimately to the independent
objective facts which they assert, inasmuch as the most successfully
validated of all claims is that such facts are there. My universe is
more essentially epistemological. I start with two things, the objective
facts and the claims, and indicate which claims, the facts being there,
will work successfully as the latter's substitutes and which will not.
I call the former claims true. Dewey's panorama, if I understand this
colleague, is the widest of the three, but I refrain from giving my own
account of its complexity. Suffice it that he holds as firmly as I do to
objects independent of our judgments. If I am wrong in saying this,
he must correct me. I decline in this matter to be corrected at second
hand.

I have not pretended in the following pages to consider all the critics
of my account of truth, such as Messrs. Taylor, Lovejoy, Gardiner,
Bakewell, Creighton, Hibben, Parodi, Salter, Carus, Lalande, Mentre,
McTaggart, G. E. Moore, Ladd and others, especially not Professor
Schinz, who has published under the title of Anti-pragmatisme an amusing
sociological romance. Some of these critics seem to me to labor under an
inability almost pathetic, to understand the thesis which they seek to
refute. I imagine that most of their difficulties have been answered
by anticipation elsewhere in this volume, and I am sure that my readers
will thank me for not adding more repetition to the fearful amount that
is already there.

THE FUNCTION OF COGNITION [Footnote: Read before the Aristotelian
Society, December 1, 1884, and first published in Mind, vol. x
(1885).--This, and the following articles have received a very slight
verbal revision, consisting mostly in the omission of redundancy.]

The following inquiry is (to use a distinction familiar to readers of
Mr. Shadworth Hodgson) not an inquiry into the 'how it comes,' but
into the 'what it is' of cognition. What we call acts of cognition are
evidently realized through what we call brains and their events, whether
there be 'souls' dynamically connected with the brains or not. But with
neither brains nor souls has this essay any business to transact. In it
we shall simply assume that cognition IS produced, somehow, and limit
ourselves to asking what elements it contains, what factors it implies.
