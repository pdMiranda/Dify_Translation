THE PREFACE.

H_AVING taken more than ordinary Pains in collecting the Materials
which compose the following History, we could not be satisfied with our
selves, if any Thing were wanting to it, which might render it entirely
satisfactory to the Publick: It is for this Reason we have subjoined to the
Work, a short Abstract of the Laws now in Force against Pyrates, and made
Choice of some particular Cases, (the most curious we could meet with)
which have been heretofore tried, by which it will appear what Actions
have, and what have not been adjudged Pyracy._

_It is possible this Book may fall into the Hands of some Masters of Ships,
and other honest Mariners, who frequently, by contrary Winds or Tempests,
or other Accidents incident to long Voyages, find themselves reduced to
great Distresses, either through Scarcity of Provisions, or Want of Stores.
I say, it may be a Direction to such as those, what Lengths they may
venture to go, without violating the Law of Nations, in Case they should
meet other Ships at Sea, or be cast on some inhospitable Shore, which
should refuse to trade with them for such Things as are absolutely
necessary for the Preservation of their Lives, or the Safety of the Ship
and Cargoe._

_We have given a few Instances in the Course of this History of the
Inducements Men have to engage themselves headlong in a Life of so much
Peril to themselves, and so destructive to the Navigation of the trading
World; to remedy which Evil there seems to be but two Ways, either to find
Employment for the great Numbers of Seamen turn'd adrift at the Conclusion
of a War, and thereby prevent their running into such Undertakings, or to
guard sufficiently the Coast of _Africa_, the _West-Indies_, and other
Places whereto Pyrates resort._
