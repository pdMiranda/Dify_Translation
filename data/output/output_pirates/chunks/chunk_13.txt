As it was in full Peace, and contrary to all Justice and Right, that this
Fact was committed, they were soon made sensible that the Government at
_Jamaica_ would not suffer them to go unpunished, much less protect them.
Therefore they saw a Necessity of shifting for themselves; so, to make bad
worse, they went to Sea again, tho' not without disposing of their Cargo to
good Advantage, and furnishing themselves with Ammunition, Provisions,
_&c._ and being thus made desperate, they turn'd Pyrates, robbing not the
_Spaniards_ only, but their own Countrymen, and any Nation they could lay
their Hands on.

It happened about this Time, that the _Spaniards_, with three or four small
Men of War, fell upon our Logwood Cutters, in the Bay of _Campeachy_, and
Bay or _Honduras_; and after they had made Prizes of the following Ships
and Vessels, they gave the Men belonging to them, three Sloops to carry
them home, but these Men being made desperate by their Misfortunes, and
meeting with the Pyrates, they took on with them, and so encreas'd their
Number.

The Rovers being now pretty strong, they consulted together about getting
some Place of Retreat, where they might lodge their Wealth, clean and
repair their Ships, and make themselves a kind of Abode. They were not long
in resolving, but fixed upon the Island of _Providence_, the most
considerable of the _Bahama_ Islands, lying in the Latitude of about 24
Degrees North, and to the Eastward of the _Spanish Florida_.

This Island is about 28 Miles long, and eleven where broadest, and has a
Harbour big enough to hold 500 Sail of Ships; before which lies a small
Island, which makes two Inlets to the Harbour; at either Way there is a
Bar, over which no Ship of 500 Tun can pass. The _Bahama_ Islands were
possess'd by the _English_ till the Year 1700, when the _French_ and
_Spaniards_ from _Petit Guavus_, invaded them, took the Fort and Governor
in the Island of _Providence_, plunder'd and destroy'd the Settlements,
_&c._ carried off half the Blacks, and the rest of the People, who fled to
the Woods, retired afterwards to _Carolina_.
