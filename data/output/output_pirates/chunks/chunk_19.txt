`THE frequent Depredations, Robberies, and
   other Acts of Hostility, which have been
   committed on the King my Royal Master's Subjects,
   by a Parcel of Banditti, who pretend to
   have Commissions from you, and in Reality are
   sheltered under your Government, is the Occasion
   of my sending the Bearer Captain _Chamberlain_,
   Commander of his Majesty's Snow _Happy_,
   to demand Satisfaction of you for so many notorious
   Robberies which your People have lately
   committed on the King's Subjects of this Island;
   particularly by those Traytors, _Nicolas Brown_
   and _Christopher Winter_, to whom you have given
   Protection. Such Proceedings as these are not
   only a Breach of the Law of Nations, but must
   appear to the World of a very extraordinary
   Nature, when considered that the Subjects of a
   Prince in Amity and Friendship with another,
   should give Countenance and encourage such vile
   Practices. I confess I have had long Patience, and
   declined using any violent Measures to obtain
   Satisfaction, hoping the Cessation of Arms, so
   happily concluded upon between our respective
   Sovereigns, would have put an effectual Stop to
   those Disorders; but on the contrary, I now find
   the Port of _Trinidado_ a Receptacle to Villains
   of all Nations. I do therefore think fit to acquaint
   you, and assure you in the King my Master's
   Name, that if I do meet with any of your
   Rogues for the future upon the Coast of this
   Island, I will order them to be hanged directly
   without Mercy; and I expect and demand of
   you to make ample Restitution to Captain _Chamberlain_
   or all the Negroes which the said _Brown_
   and Winter have lately taken off from the North-Side
   of this Island, and also of such Sloops and
   other Effects as they have been taken and robbed
   of, since the Cessation of Arms, and that you
   will deliver up to the Bearer such _English_ Men
   as are now detained, or otherwise remain at _Trinidado_;
   and also expect you will hereafter forbear
   granting any Commissions, or suffer any such
   notorious Villains to be equipp'd and fitted out
   from your Port: otherwise you may depend upon
   it, those that I can meet with, shall be esteemed
   Pyrates, and treated as such; of which I thought
   proper to give you Notice, and am, _&c._

_A Letter from Mr. _Joseph Laws_, Lieutenant of his Majesty's Ship,
_Happy_ Snow, to the Alcaldes of _Trinidado_._

Genlemen,

`I Am sent by Commadore _Vernon_, Commander
   in Chief of all his Majesty's Ships in the
   _West-Indies_ to demand in the King our Master's
   Name, all the Vessels, with theirs Effects, _&c._
   and also the Negroes taken from _Jamaica_ since the
   Cessation of Arms; likewise all _Englishmen_ now
   detained, or otherwise remaining in your Port of
   _Trinidado_, particularly _Nicholas Brown_ and _Christopher
   Winter_, both of them being Traytors, Pyrates
   and common Enemies to all Nations: And
   the said Commadore hath ordered me to acquaint
   you, that he is surprized that the Subjects of a
   Prince in Amity and Friendship with another,
   should give Countenance to such notorious Villains.
   In Expectation of your immediate Compliance,
   I am, Gentlemen,

Off the River _Trinidado_, _Feb._ 8. 1720.

Your humble Servant, _Joseph Laws_.

_The Answer of the Alcaldes of _Trinidado_, to Mr. _Laws_'s Letter._

Capt. Laws,
