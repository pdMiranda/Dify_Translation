The destroying this Pyrate was look'd upon by the Province, to be of such a
signal Service to the Publick, and particular Advantage to the Colony of
_New-York_, that it was thought necessary to make some handsome
Acknowledgement to Captain _Peter Solgard_ for it; and therefore it was
resolved, in an Assembly of the Common-Council, to compliment him with the
Freedom of their Corporation. The Resolution, together with the Preamble of
the Captain's Freedom, being curious in their Kind, I subjoin them for the
Satisfaction of the Reader.

Resolution of the Mayor and Common-Council of the City of _New-York_,
at a Common-Council held at the City Hall of the said City, on _Thursday_
the 25th of _July, Anno. Dom._ 1723.

Present _Robert Walter_, Esq; Mayor.
