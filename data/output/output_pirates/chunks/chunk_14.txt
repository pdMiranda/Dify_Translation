`That the
   _French_ and _Spaniards_ had twice, during the Time
   of the War, over run and plundered the _Bahama_
   Islands, that there was no Form of Government
   there: That the Harbour of the Isle of _Providence_,
   might be easily put in a Posture of Defence, and
   that it would be of dangerous Consequence, should
   those Islands fall into the Hands of the Enemy;
   wherefore the Lords humbly besought her Majesty
   to use such Methods as she should think
   proper for taking the said Island into her Hands,
   in order to secure the same to the Crown of this
   Kingdom, and to the Security and Advantage
   of the Trade thereof.

But, however it happened, no Means were used in compliance to that Address,
for securing the _Bahama_ Islands, till the _English_ Pyrates had made
_Providence_ their Retreat and general Receptacle; then 'twas found
absolutely necessary, in order to dislodge that troublesome Colony; and
Information being made by the Merchants to the Government, of the Mischief
they did, and were likely to do, his Majesty was pleased to grant the
following Order.

_Whitehall September_ 15, 1716.

`COmplaint having been made to his Majesty,
   by great Number of Merchants, Masters of
   Ships and others, as well as by several Governors
   of his Majesty's Islands and Plantations in the
   _West-Indies_; that the Pyrates are grown so numerous,
   that they infest not only the Seas near _Jamaica_,
   but even those of the Northern Continent
   of _America_; and that, unless some effectual Means
   be used, the whole Trade from _Great Britain_ to
   those Parts, will not be only obstructed, but in
   imminent Danger of being lost: His Majesty has,
   upon mature Deliberation in Council, been pleased,
   in the first Place, to order a proper Force
   to be employ'd for the suppressing the said Pyrates,
   which Force so to be employed, is as
   follows.

`A List of his Majesty's Ships and Vessels employed, and to be
employed, at the British Governments and Plantations in the _West-Indies_.

`Those at _Jamaica_, _Barbadoes_ and the Leeward
   Islands, are to join upon Occasion, for annoying
   the Pyrates, and the Security of the Trade: And
   those at _New-England_, _Virginia_ and _New-York_, are
   to do the like.
