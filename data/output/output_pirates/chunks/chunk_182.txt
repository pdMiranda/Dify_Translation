The Remainder of the Pyrates, whose Names are under mentioned, upon their

seven Years Servitude, conformable to our Sentence of Transportation; the
Petition is as follows.

* * *

_To the Honourable the President and Judges of the Court of
Admiralty, for trying of Pyrates, sitting at_ Cape Corso-Castle; _the_
20_th Day of_ April, 1722.

The humble Petition of _Thomas How, Samuel Fletcher_, &c.

Humbly sheweth,

T_HAT your Petitioners being unhappily, and unwarily drawn into that
wretched and detestable Crime of Pyracy, for which they now stand justly
condemned, they most humbly pray the Clemency of the Court, in the
Mitigation of their Sentence, that they may be permitted to serve the
Royal_ African _Company of_ England, _in this Country for seven Years, in
such a Manner as the Court shall think proper; that by their just
Punishment, being made sensible of the Error of their former Ways, they
will for the future become faithful Subjects, good Servants, and useful in
their Stations, if it please the Almighty to prolong their Lives._

And your Petitioners, as in Duty, _&c._

The Resolution of the Court was,

T_HAT the Petitioners have Leave by this Court of Admiralty, to
interchange Indentures with the Captain General of the_ Gold Coast, _for
the Royal_ African _Company, for seven Years Servitude, at any of the
Royal_ African _Company's Settlements in_ Africa, _in such Manner as he the
said Captain General shall think proper._
