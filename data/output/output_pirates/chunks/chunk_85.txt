But what was very surprizing, was, the Conviction of the nine Men that came
aboard the Sloop the same Day she was taken. They were try'd at an
Adjournment of the Court, on the 24th of _January_, waiting all that Time,
it is supposed, for Evidence, to prove the pyratical Intention of going
aboard the said Sloop; for it seems there was no Act of Pyracy committed by
them, after their coming on Board, as appeared by the Witnesses against
them, who were two _French_ Men taken by _Rackam_, off from the Island of
_Hispaniola_, and deposed in the following Manner.

`That the Prisoners at the Bar, _viz. John Eaton,
   Edward Warner, Thomas Baker, Thomas Quick, John Cole,
   Benjamin Palmer, Walter Rouse, John Hanson_, and _John
   Howard_, came aboard the Pyrate's Sloop at _Negril
   Point, Rackam_ sending his Canoe ashore for that
   Purpose: That they brought Guns and Cutlashes on Board
   with them: That when Captain
   _Barnet_ chased them, some were drinking, and others
   walking the Deck: That there was a great Gun and a
   small Arm fired by the Pyrate Sloop, at Captain
   _Barnet_'s Sloop, when he chased her; and that when
   Captain _Barnet_'s Sloop fired at _Rackam_'s Sloop, the
   Prisoners at the Bar went down under Deck. That during
   the Time Captain _Barnet_ chased them, some of the
   Prisoners at the Bar (but which of them he could not
   tell) helped to row the Sloop, in order to escape from
   _Barnet_: That they all seemed to be consorted
   together.

This was the Substance of all that was evidenced against them, the
Prisoners answered in their Defence,

`That they had no Witnesses: That they had bought a
   Pettiauger in order to go a Turtleing; and being at
   _Negril Point_, and just got ashore, they saw a Sloop
   with a white Pendant coming towards them, upon which
   they took their Arms, and hid themselves in the Bushes:
   That one of them hail'd the Sloop, who answer'd, _They
   were_ English _Men_, and desired them to come aboard
   and drink a Bowl of Punch; which they at first refused,
   but afterwards with much perswasion, they went on
   Board, in the Sloop's Canoe, and left their own
   Pettiauger at Anchor: That they had been but a short
   Time on Board, when Captain _Barnet_'s Sloop heaved in
   Sight: That _Rackam_ ordered them to help to weigh the
   Sloop's Anchor immediately, which they all refused:
   That _Rackam_ used violent Means to oblige them; and
   that when Captain _Barnet_ came up with them, they all
   readily and willingly submitted.

When the Prisoners were taken from the Bar, and the Persons present being
withdrawn, the Court considered the Prisoners Cases, and the Majority of
the Commissioners being of Opinion, that they were all Guilty of the Pyracy
and Felony they were charged with, which was, _the going over with a
pyratical and felonious Intent to_ John Rackam, &c. _then notorious
Pyrates, and by them known to be so_, they all received Sentence of Death;
which every Body must allow proved somewhat unlucky to the poor Fellows.

On the 17th of _February, John Eaton, Thomas Quick_ and _Thomas Baker_,
were executed at _Gallows Point_, at _Port Royal_, and the next Day _John
Cole, John Howard_ and _Benjamin Palmer_, were executed at _Kingston_;
whether the other three were executed afterwards, or not, I never heard.
