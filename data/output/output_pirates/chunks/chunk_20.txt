`IN Answer to yours, this serves to acquaint
   you, that neither in this City, nor Port, are
   there any Negroes or Vessels which have been taken
   at your Island of _Jamaica_, nor on that Coast,
   since the Cessation of Arms; and what Vessels
   have been taken since that Time, have been for
   trading in an unlawful Commerce on this Coast;
   and as for those English Fugitives you mention,
   they are here as other Subjects of our Lord the
   King, being brought voluntarily to our holy Catholick
   Faith, and have received the Water of
   Baptism; but if they should prove Rogues, and
   should not comply with their Duty, in which
   they are bound at present, then they shall be
   chastized according to the Ordinances of our
   King, whom God preserve. And we beg you will
   weigh Anchor as soon as possible, and leave this
   Port and its Coasts, because upon no Account you
   shall be suffered to trade, or any Thing else; for
   we are resolved not to admit thereof. God preserve
   you. We kiss your Hand.

_Mr. _Laws_'s Reply to the Alcaldes Letter._

Gentlemen,

`YOUR refusing to deliver up the Subjects of
   the King my Master, is somewhat surprizing,
   it being in a Time of Peace, and the detaining
   them consequently against the Law of Nations.
   Notwithstanding your trifling Pretence
   (for which you have no Foundation but to forge an
   Excuse) to prevent my making any Enquiry into
   the Truth of the Facts I have alledged in my
   former, I must tell you my Resolutions are, to
   stay on the Coast till I have made Reprizals; and
   should I meet any Vessels belonging to your Port,
   I shall not treat them as the Subjects of the Crown
   of Spain, but as Pyrates, finding it a Part of your
   Religion in this Place to protect such Villains.

Off the River _Trinidado_, _Feb._ 8. 1720.

Your humble Servant, _Joseph Laws_.

_The Answer of one of the Alcaldes to Mr. _Laws_'s Reply_.

Captain Laws,

`YOU may assure your self, I will never be
   wanting in the Duty of my Post. The
   Prisoners that are here are not in Prison, but
   only kept here to be sent to the Governor of the
   _Havana_: If you (as you say) command at Sea, I
   command on Shoar: If you treat the _Spaniards_,
   you should happen to take, as Pyrates, I will do
   the same by every one of your People I can
   take up: I will not be wanting to good Manners,
   if you will do the same. I can likewise act the
   Soldier, if any Occasion should offer that way,
   for I have very good People here for that purpose.
   If you pretend any Thing else, you may execute
   it on this Coast. God preserve you. I kiss your
   Hand.

_Trinidado_, _Feb._ 20. 1720.
